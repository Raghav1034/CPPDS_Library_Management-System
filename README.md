# Library Management System using Hash Table

This C++ program implements a simple Library Management System using a hash table data structure. The system allows users to manage a library by performing operations such as displaying books, issuing books to students, returning books, searching for students, and displaying the hash table.

## Features
- Display available books with their titles and IDs.
- Issue books to students, ensuring a book can only be issued once by a student.
- Return books, tracking the book's location for efficient return.
- Search for students and find the issued book.
- Display the internal structure of the hash table for efficient book management.
- Use of prime-sized arrays for the hash table to minimize collisions and enhance performance.

## Prerequisites
- C++ compiler (e.g., g++)
- Terminal or IDE for running the code


5. Follow the on-screen instructions to interact with the Library Management System.

## Code Explanation

The code consists of a C++ program structured as follows:

- `HashTable` Class:
 - Manages the library, including book storage and hash table operations.
 - Keeps track of book titles and IDs.
 - Enforces constraints on book issuance and return.

- `main()` Function:
 - Implements the menu for library management operations.
 - Utilizes the `HashTable` class for book management.
 - Allows users to interact with the system and perform various actions.

For a detailed explanation of how the code works, please refer to the [Code Explanation](#code-explanation) section in the README.

## Improvements
The Library Management System can be further improved with the following enhancements:
- User authentication and access control.
- Database integration for storing book and student information.
- Enhanced error handling and data validation.
- Implementing a dynamic array resizing strategy for the hash table.
